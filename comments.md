Some issues:

* No calendar implementation.
* At the greedy algorithm, you implement your own sorting algorithm of complexity O(n^2). Not the best choice when you can use Java built-in methods for O(nlogn).
* Pruning could improve backtracking by not exploring branches which we calculate won't mathematically provide a result.

Good work overall.
